<h2 id="w-caerdon-wardrobe">Caerdon Wardrobe</h2>
<p>Let Caerdon Wardrobe help you get your transmog closet overflowing with style ...<em> you fabulous thing, you</em>! You'll gain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show BOE / BOA on bank / bag / merchant items</li>
<li>Show assigned gear set on bank / bag items</li>
<li>Add indicators showing unlearned wardrobe appearances to the following:
<ul>
<li>Bank</li>
<li>Bag</li>
<li>Guild Bank</li>
<li>Auctions</li>
<li>Merchants</li>
<li>Adventure Guide's Dungeon and Raid Journal</li>
<li>Loot pickup</li>
<li>Group loot rolls</li>
<li><ins> Options Panel to turn on / off all of these features and reposition the icon / text </ins></li>
<li><ins> Completionist option that will flag unlearned items for appearances you already know </ins>
<ul>
<li>One reason to learn multiple items with the same appearance is that items still have level restrictions enforced, and a different item may require a lower level for your other toons</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that for the Adventure Guide, Legion instances are currently not returning the data. I haven't looked into it, yet, but I'm guessing that will change when Legion goes live.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides separate indicators for items specific to your class vs. something you'd need to send to and / or learn on an alt.</li>
<li>Show bag icon for items that you have learned for transmog that don't have an on-use or on-equip effect (sell those things!)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="w-how-the-icons-work">How the icons work:</h3>
<p><strong>Stars</strong> - You don't know this appearance yet, and your current toon can equip it and learn it.</p>
<p><strong>Question Mark</strong> - You don't know this appearance yet, but your current toon cannot learn it. You'll have to send the item to the correct class to learn it.</p>
<p><strong>Bag</strong> - This item has been learned and is in your wardrobe. It also doesn't have any on-use or on-equip effects, so you're free to sell it!</p>
<p>If you're seeing Stars or Question Marks in any other case, it's either a defect, or it's possible that Blizzard missed an appearance in which case you should search for it in the Transmog Collection.</p>
<hr />
<p>As with all Caerdon add-ons, this assumes and builds on top of the existing Blizzard functionality. If you're replacing the bag, bank, merchant, or auction house views with another add-on, you may not receive the full functionality of this add-on unless a Caerdon integration add-on has been provided.</p>
<p>Caerdon add-ons prefer simplicity over customization. I try for sane defaults but with all the custom bag add-ons, this proved difficult, so Caerdon Wardrobe has a full set of customizable options to turn things on / off and move 'em around.</p>
